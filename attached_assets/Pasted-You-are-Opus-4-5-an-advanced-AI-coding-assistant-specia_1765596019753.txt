You are Opus 4.5, an advanced AI coding assistant specialized in rapid app development. Your task is to build a fully functional MVP of the "Normie Companion App" on Replit, aligning with the provided development plan and incorporating Replit's best practices for web app development. Focus on creating a visually stunning, interactive web app that tracks the $NORMIE memecoin in near-real-time and integrates visual components with a shop, all while emphasizing security, iteration, and AI-assisted workflows.
App Overview and Mission Alignment
The app is a companion for the $NORMIE memecoin (Solana-based, from pump.fun/coin/FrSFwE2BxWADEyUWFXDMAeomzuB4r83ZvzdG9sevpump), inspired by @NormieCEO's vision on X: relentless token burns/locks (e.g., 572M tokens removed), community engagement ("get chaotic"), and merch empire (coffee, hoodies, etc.). It features:

Real-Time Tracking Dashboard: Near-live metrics (price, mcap, liquidity, holders, burns) from Solana APIs.
Interactive Components & Shop: Meme generators, polls, community links, and a merch shop with crypto payments.

Build this as a full-stack web app: Node.js/Express backend for API handling, React frontend for interactivity. Use dark-mode UI with 4chan-inspired greens/blacks.
Replit Best Practices to Follow
Adhere strictly to these for efficient, secure development:

Start with a Template: Use the Express.js template for backend setup, then add React via create-react-app or Replit's frontend tools.
Use Replit Agent for Core Build: Feed a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) to Agent for initial scaffolding. Iterate with checkpoints for rollbacks.
Leverage Replit Assistant for Refinements: Use for targeted changes like adding dependencies, fixing bugs, or styling—provide specific prompts with file references (e.g., @index.js).
Craft Specific, Iterative Prompts: Be descriptive; include visuals/mockups if possible. Build MVP first, then refine via feedback loops.
Security Fundamentals: Use HTTPS; validate/sanitize inputs; store API keys in Replit Secrets; prevent SQL injection (if using DB); apply rate limiting; secure cookies; update dependencies.
Dependency Management: Add via Assistant or Dependencies tab (e.g., solana/web3.js for blockchain, stripe or solana-pay for shop, chart.js for visuals).
Workflow Customization: Install nodemon for auto-restarts; manage workflows via Run button.
Collaboration & Iteration: Start simple, test in Preview tab, gather feedback, iterate. Use Git for version control.
Publishing: Secure secrets before publishing; deploy with public URL for community testing.
Debugging: Use browser DevTools and paste errors into Agent/Assistant for fixes.

Step-by-Step Build Instructions
Follow this phased approach, documenting your progress in a README.md file within the Repl.
Phase 1: Setup and Foundation (Week 1 Equivalent)

Create a new private Repl using Express.js template.
Write a PRD in a markdown file: Detail features, UI (dark theme, animated charts), tech stack (Node/Express backend, React frontend, Solana integrations).
Feed PRD to Replit Agent: Prompt: "Build a minimalist MVP web app based on this PRD: Real-time $NORMIE tracking dashboard pulling from Solana RPC/pump.fun APIs (refresh every 5-10s via WebSockets); interactive meme generator and polls; basic shop with mock merch items. Use React for frontend, Express for backend. Apply 4chan-inspired styling."
Approve Agent's plan, review previews, and let it scaffold.
Add dependencies: solana/web3.js, axios (for APIs), socket.io (for live updates), react-chartjs-2 (for visuals), stripe or @solana/pay (for payments).

Phase 2: Implement Real-Time Tracking (Weeks 2-3)

Use Assistant: Prompt: "In the backend (@server.js), integrate Solana RPC to fetch $NORMIE metrics (price, mcap, liquidity, holders, burned tokens). Expose via API endpoints. Add WebSockets for 5-10s refreshes."
Frontend: Prompt Assistant: "In React components (@App.js), create a dashboard with animated line charts (Chart.js), radial gauges, and a supply ticker. Fetch data from backend API. Add customizable alerts."
Security: Validate API inputs; use Replit Secrets for any keys (e.g., RPC endpoint if private).
Test: Run and preview; debug errors via DevTools and Assistant.

Phase 3: Interactive Components & Shop (Weeks 3-4)

Interactive: Prompt Agent/Assistant: "Add drag-and-drop meme generator with Normie stickers; live polls linking to Telegram (@TheNormieNation); chat bubbles for X sharing."
Shop: Prompt: "Integrate a virtual storefront with 3D previews (use three.js if needed), carousel for merch (hoodies, coffee). Add one-click Solana Pay integration. Personalize based on user activity."
UI: Ensure immersive design—animations, hover effects. Prompt: "Apply dark-mode with green accents; fix any UI bugs like misplaced elements."
Security: Secure file uploads (if memes involve images); rate limit endpoints; handle errors gracefully.

Phase 4: Testing, Polish, and Publish (Weeks 5-6)

Test end-to-end: Simulate live data, interactions, purchases.
Refine: Gather "feedback" by prompting Assistant: "Suggest improvements for user engagement and performance."
Secure: Run security checklist—HTTPS, no exposed secrets, updated deps.
Publish: Use Replit's publish tool; generate public URL.
Document: Update README with setup, run instructions, and mission alignment.

Output Expectations

Once built, provide the Replit project link.
Share key code snippets for features.
Explain any deviations from the plan and why (e.g., for better performance).
Ensure the app is mobile-responsive and performant.

Begin building now, Opus 4.5. Prioritize visuals and user experience—make it beautiful before fully functional. Let's turn Normie into a digital powerhouse!
